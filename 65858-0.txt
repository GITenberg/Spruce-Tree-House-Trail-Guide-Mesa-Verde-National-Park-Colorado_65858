                           SPRUCE TREE HOUSE


Station 1.   Spruce Tree House is the third largest cliff dwelling in
Mesa Verde National Park. It is built in a natural cave 216 feet in
length, 89 feet in greatest depth, and 60 feet in greatest height. The
complete dwelling contained about 114 rooms. Most of these were living
rooms, but there were many storerooms and 8 ceremonial rooms. It is
thought that between 200 and 250 people may have lived in this cliff
house at one time. It was occupied from about A.D. 1200 to, or shortly
before, A.D. 1300.

    [Illustration: _The First Court_]


Station 2.   Spruce Tree House is typical of the larger cliff dwellings
found in the Mesa Verde. It consists of several groups or blocks of
rooms around open courts. Within each court is an underground ceremonial
room called a kiva (Key-vah). Originally, there were flat roofs on these
kivas. These roofs formed the courtyard floor and provided work space
for daily activities. The rooms around the court were used primarily for
sleeping and storage and for shelter against the cold of winter.

The rooms are generally small, averaging 6 by 8 feet and 5½ feet high.
Floors and roofs of the second and third stories were made of large
poles covered with smaller sticks, then bark or grass, and a thick layer
of clay. A few of the rooms had fireplaces but most were without
interior light or heat. Probably one family occupied a room.

Compare the picture of the First Court with the dwelling to locate the
following:

A. These are unshaped building stones. Most of the building blocks used
in the dwelling were carefully shaped by the Indians before they were
set in place. The walls were built of stone with adobe clay as mortar,
much as we would build with brick. When a wall was finished, it was
often coated with a layer of clay plaster.

B. These were storage rooms.

C. Each room had individual doorways such as these.

D. Some rooms had ventilation openings or “windows” like this one.


Station 3.   In the corner of the court to your left are corn grinding
bins. Women knelt with their heels against the wall and ground corn,
dried nuts, berries and roots on the large flat stone, the metate, with
the small hand stone, the mano.

The circular room directly ahead of you is one of two found in this
dwelling. Circular rooms were not common but they have been found in
several ruins.

    [Illustration: _The Second Court. Main street section._]

Note the passageway or “street” which provided access to rooms at the
back of the cave in this part of the dwelling.

    [Illustration: _Ground plan of a kiva._]

  Sipapu
  Pilasters
  Banquette
  Firepit
  Deflector
  Ventilator Shaft

Step into the courtyard and look into the kiva. The name kiva is a
modern Hopi Indian word meaning ceremonial room. Judging by present day
Pueblo Indian custom, generally only men would be members of kiva
societies which performed religious ceremonies for bringing rain, good
crops and general well-being to the village. Women undoubtedly assisted
in some ceremonies. When no rituals were being held, the kiva probably
was used as a clubroom and workroom by men.

The _ventilator shaft_ brought fresh air into the kiva. The _deflector_
was a baffle to keep the air from blowing directly across the _firepit_
in the floor. The fire provided light and warmth. The _sipapu_
(see-pah-pooh) was a symbolic opening from the underworld of the gods
and spirits. The bench, or _banquette_, was a shelf or storage space.
The _pilasters_, of which there are generally six, were roof supports.
Entrance to the kiva was by means of a ladder through a hatchway in the
roof.

If you want to go into a kiva, climb down the ladder in front of the
next courtyard. Notice the cribbed roof. This is a restoration copied
from originals found in place in other ruins.


Station 4.   Behind the rooms in this part of the dwelling is a large
enclosed area which was used as a trash room. The villagers also kept
some of their domesticated turkeys penned up in it. The main village
trash dump was the talus slope on which you are now standing.

The black stain on the cave roof is smoke.

Notice the wall decorations on the second floor room to the left. It was
made by plastering colored clay on the walls. Many rooms were once
decorated inside like this one.

Station 5.   Spruce Tree House 700 years ago was a thriving village. If
you could have visited it you would have seen women busily cooking over
firepits in the courtyards, others grinding corn, weaving baskets or
making pottery. Men who were not tending their mesa-top fields might
have been building a new room, making or mending their tools or
performing an age-old ceremony in one of the kivas. You would have seen
children playing and old people resting against the low wall across the
front of the dwelling as they basked in the warm sun dreaming of their
younger days. There would also be dogs and turkeys wandering through the
village and picking over the trash dump for bits to eat. Unfortunately,
this all came to an end shortly before A.D. 1300.

    [Illustration: uncaptioned]

Compare the illustration with the dwelling to locate the following:

A. These are doorways. Some are T-shaped, some are rectangular, but we
don’t know why the two types. Notice that some of the doorways were
closed with stone slabs.

B. These original timbers supported a balcony as well as the floors in
the rooms. Balconies made it easy to get into the upper rooms. Balconies
and rooftops were reached by ladders.

C. Most of the cooking was done outside in the courtyards over firepits
like this one. Very few of the rooms had firepits in them.

D. This was a storage bin made of sandstone slabs.

E. The courtyard was the scene of most of the daily activities—grinding
corn, preparing food, making tools, pottery, etc.

F. The ladders lead to kivas beneath the courtyard. These ladders and
kiva roofs have been restored.

    [Illustration: _Spruce Tree House from the north end_]


Station 6.   The cliff dwelling was named Spruce Tree House by the
ranchers who first discovered it in 1888. A large tree which they
misidentified as a spruce tree was found growing against the cliff right
in front of the dwelling. It is said that the men first entered the ruin
by climbing down this tree.

This is a good place to take a picture.

                          GENERAL INFORMATION


Spruce Tree House is the third largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde
National Park. It is located in Spruce Tree Canyon, a branch of the much
larger Navajo Canyon. The cave, which is really a very large overhang,
was formed by flaking or spalling of the cliff above a small
seep-spring, and by freezing and thawing during the winter. There is no
evidence that the Indians tried to shape or enlarge the caves; to do so
would have been a tremendous task with their primitive tools.

Spruce Tree House was an Indian village and, like towns and villages
today, it was not all built at one time; rather, it grew section by
section over a period of years. Sometime around A.D. 1200 a group of
Indians—perhaps related families—moved into the cave and built the first
units. Each unit consisted of living and storage rooms clustered about
an open court which contained a kiva. The courtyard and kiva probably
served as a center for the social and religious activities of the group.
New units were added to the structure as other families moved into the
village. When people needed more space, they added new rooms alongside,
in front, in back, or on top of the existing rooms. Shortly before A.D.
1300 when the Indians finally abandoned Spruce Tree House, the village
contained 114 rooms.

The ground plan on Page 6 shows the arrangement of the rooms. Most of
these were in double rows within the cave; in some places there were
three rows. The interior rooms, dark and poorly ventilated, were
probably used for storage. The central portion of the structure was
built three stories high and reached the cave ceiling; most of the
buildings, however, were only two stories in height.

To us these small rooms seem cramped, cold, and dark—quite unsuitable as
living spaces. But these people probably spent little time inside the
rooms, using them mainly for protection against the cold, for sleeping,
and for storage. Most of the time they were probably out in the
courtyards or on the flat rooftops working or carrying on other daily
activities.

It is unlikely that all 114 rooms in Spruce Tree House were in use at
the same time. New rooms were built as older ones fell into decay;
smaller rooms were probably vacated for larger ones as the number of
villagers increased. A conservative guess sets 200 to 250 as the largest
number of people who lived in Spruce Tree House at any one time.

The Indians of the Mesa Verde, like their neighbors in the surrounding
areas, were dry-farmers—depending upon rainfall to water their crops. In
the fields on the mesa tops they grew corn, beans and several varieties
of squash. The rainfall probably averaged about 18 inches a year, just
as it does now, which is more than sufficient for dry-farming. The
Indians supplemented their diet with wild roots, nuts and berries as
well as with meat from large and small game animals.

The period of the cliff dwellings is known as the Classic Period and
marks the climax of Pueblo culture in this region. The Mesa Verde people
made beautiful pottery and decorated it elaborately with geometric and
animal figures in black on a white or light-gray background. They also
made cotton cloth which they often decorated with colored designs. Their
masonry was of exceptional quality with the building blocks beautifully
shaped and carefully laid in clay mortar.

The Classic Period came to an end shortly before A.D. 1300 when the
Indians abandoned their homes in the Mesa Verde and moved away. We can
only guess the reasons for such a move. One suggestion is that the great
drouth, which lasted from A.D. 1276 to A.D. 1299, caused them to leave.
Another suggestion is that this was a period of strife either between
the villages themselves or between these village people and nomadic
groups moving into the area. Whatever the reasons, the cliff dwellings
of the Mesa Verde were empty by A.D. 1300.

It was a rancher from Mancos, named Richard Wetherill, who first
discovered Spruce Tree House—on December 18, 1888. He and his
brother-in-law, Charley Mason, also discovered Cliff Palace that same
day. The men had been looking for lost cattle when they first saw the
cliff ruins.

    [Illustration: _Spruce Tree ruin before excavation._]

    [Illustration: _And the ruin after excavation and stabilization._]

In 1906 Mesa Verde was set aside as a National Park by Act of Congress
to protect and preserve these dwellings of the prehistoric Indians. In
1908 Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution excavated
Spruce Tree House. He removed the debris of fallen walls and collapsed
roofs and stabilized the dwellings more or less as you see them now. It
has been necessary, of course, to further stabilize the walls from time
to time, but aside from minor repairs and the roofing of the three
kivas, the dwelling is original work done by the Indians some 700 to 800
years ago.

The dating of Spruce Tree House and other ruins in the Mesa Verde has
been done by the study of tree-rings from original roofing timbers. If
you are interested in how archæologists determine the dates, see the
exhibit on tree-ring dating in the museum.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
