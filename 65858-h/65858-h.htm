<h1 title="">SPRUCE TREE HOUSE</h1>
<h3 class="inline" id="c1">Station 1.</h3>
<p>Spruce Tree House is the third largest cliff
dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. It is built in a natural
cave 216 feet in length, 89 feet in greatest depth, and 60 feet
in greatest height. The complete dwelling contained about
114 rooms. Most of these were living rooms, but there were
many storerooms and 8 ceremonial rooms. It is thought that
between 200 and 250 people may have lived in this cliff house
at one time. It was occupied from about <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1200 to, or
shortly before, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="inline" id="c2">Station 2.</h3>
<p>Spruce Tree House is typical of the larger
cliff dwellings found in the Mesa Verde. It consists of several
groups or blocks of rooms around open courts. Within each
court is an underground ceremonial room called a kiva (Key-vah).
Originally, there were flat roofs on these kivas. These
roofs formed the courtyard floor and provided work space for
daily activities. The rooms around the court were used primarily
for sleeping and storage and for shelter against the
cold of winter.</p>
<p>The rooms are generally small, averaging 6 by 8 feet and
5&frac12; feet high. Floors and roofs of the second and third stories
were made of large poles covered with smaller sticks, then
bark or grass, and a thick layer of clay. A few of the rooms
had fireplaces but most were without interior light or heat.
Probably one family occupied a room.</p>
<p>Compare the picture of the First Court with the dwelling
to locate the following:</p>
<p>A. These are unshaped building stones. Most of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
building blocks used in the dwelling were carefully shaped
by the Indians before they were set in place. The walls were
built of stone with adobe clay as mortar, much as we would
build with brick. When a wall was finished, it was often
coated with a layer of clay plaster.</p>
<p>B. These were storage rooms.</p>
<p>C. Each room had individual doorways such as these.</p>
<p>D. Some rooms had ventilation openings or &ldquo;windows&rdquo;
like this one.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c3">Station 3.</h3>
<p>In the corner of the court to your left are corn
grinding bins. Women knelt with their heels against the wall
and ground corn, dried nuts, berries and roots on the large
flat stone, the metate, with the small hand stone, the mano.</p>
<p>The circular room directly ahead of you is one of two found
in this dwelling. Circular rooms were not common but they
have been found in several ruins.</p>

<p>Step into the courtyard and look into the kiva. The name
kiva is a modern Hopi Indian word meaning ceremonial room.
Judging by present day Pueblo Indian custom, generally only
men would be members of kiva societies which performed
religious ceremonies for bringing rain, good crops and general
well-being to the village. Women undoubtedly assisted in some
ceremonies. When no rituals were being held, the kiva probably
was used as a clubroom and workroom by men.</p>
<p>The <i>ventilator shaft</i> brought fresh air into the kiva. The
<i>deflector</i> was a baffle to keep the air from blowing directly
across the <i>firepit</i> in the floor. The fire provided light and
warmth. The <i>sipapu</i> (see-pah-pooh) was a symbolic opening
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
from the underworld of the gods and spirits. The bench, or
<i>banquette</i>, was a shelf or storage space. The <i>pilasters</i>, of which
there are generally six, were roof supports. Entrance to the kiva
was by means of a ladder through a hatchway in the roof.</p>
<p>If you want to go into a kiva, climb down the ladder in front
of the next courtyard. Notice the cribbed roof. This is a restoration
copied from originals found in place in other ruins.</p>
<h3 class="inline" id="c4">Station 4.</h3>
<p>Behind the rooms in this part of the dwelling
is a large enclosed area which was used as a trash room. The
villagers also kept some of their domesticated turkeys penned
up in it. The main village trash dump was the talus slope on
which you are now standing.</p>
<p>The black stain on the cave roof is smoke.</p>
<p>Notice the wall decorations on the second floor room to the
left. It was made by plastering colored clay on the walls.
Many rooms were once decorated inside like this one.</p>

<h3 class="inline" id="c5">Station 5.</h3>
<p>Spruce Tree House 700 years ago was a thriving
village. If you could have visited it you would have seen
women busily cooking over firepits in the courtyards, others
grinding corn, weaving baskets or making pottery. Men who
were not tending their mesa-top fields might have been building
a new room, making or mending their tools or performing
an age-old ceremony in one of the kivas. You would have seen
children playing and old people resting against the low wall
across the front of the dwelling as they basked in the warm
sun dreaming of their younger days. There would also be dogs
and turkeys wandering through the village and picking over
the trash dump for bits to eat. Unfortunately, this all came to
an end shortly before <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300.</p>

<p>Compare the illustration with the dwelling to locate the following:</p>
<p>A. These are doorways. Some are T-shaped, some are rectangular,
but we don&rsquo;t know why the two types. Notice that some of the doorways
were closed with stone slabs.</p>
<p>B. These original timbers supported a balcony as well as the floors
in the rooms. Balconies made it easy to get into the upper rooms.
Balconies and rooftops were reached by ladders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>C. Most of the cooking was done outside in the courtyards over
firepits like this one. Very few of the rooms had firepits in them.</p>
<p>D. This was a storage bin made of sandstone slabs.</p>
<p>E. The courtyard was the scene of most of the daily activities&mdash;grinding
corn, preparing food, making tools, pottery, etc.</p>
<p>F. The ladders lead to kivas beneath the courtyard. These ladders
and kiva roofs have been restored.</p>

<p>The cliff dwelling was named Spruce Tree
House by the ranchers who first discovered it in 1888. A large
tree which they misidentified as a spruce tree was found growing
against the cliff right in front of the dwelling. It is said
that the men first entered the ruin by climbing down this tree.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">GENERAL INFORMATION</span></h2>
<p>Spruce Tree House is the third largest cliff dwelling in
Mesa Verde National Park. It is located in Spruce Tree
Canyon, a branch of the much larger Navajo Canyon. The
cave, which is really a very large overhang, was formed by
flaking or spalling of the cliff above a small seep-spring, and
by freezing and thawing during the winter. There is no evidence
that the Indians tried to shape or enlarge the caves; to do
so would have been a tremendous task with their primitive tools.</p>
<p>Spruce Tree House was an Indian village and, like towns
and villages today, it was not all built at one time; rather, it
grew section by section over a period of years. Sometime
around <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1200 a group of Indians&mdash;perhaps related families&mdash;moved
into the cave and built the first units. Each
unit consisted of living and storage rooms clustered about an
open court which contained a kiva. The courtyard and kiva
probably served as a center for the social and religious activities
of the group. New units were added to the structure as
other families moved into the village. When people needed
more space, they added new rooms alongside, in front, in
back, or on top of the existing rooms. Shortly before <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300
when the Indians finally abandoned Spruce Tree House, the
village contained 114 rooms.</p>
<p>The ground plan on <a href="#Page_6">Page 6</a> shows the arrangement of the
rooms. Most of these were in double rows within the cave;
in some places there were three rows. The interior rooms,
dark and poorly ventilated, were probably used for storage.
The central portion of the structure was built three stories
high and reached the cave ceiling; most of the buildings,
however, were only two stories in height.</p>
<p>To us these small rooms seem cramped, cold, and dark&mdash;quite
unsuitable as living spaces. But these people probably
spent little time inside the rooms, using them mainly for protection
against the cold, for sleeping, and for storage. Most
of the time they were probably out in the courtyards or on the
flat rooftops working or carrying on other daily activities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>It is unlikely that all 114 rooms in Spruce Tree House
were in use at the same time. New rooms were built as older
ones fell into decay; smaller rooms were probably vacated
for larger ones as the number of villagers increased. A conservative
guess sets 200 to 250 as the largest number of people
who lived in Spruce Tree House at any one time.</p>
<p>The Indians of the Mesa Verde, like their neighbors in
the surrounding areas, were dry-farmers&mdash;depending upon
rainfall to water their crops. In the fields on the mesa tops
they grew corn, beans and several varieties of squash. The rainfall
probably averaged about 18 inches a year, just as it does
now, which is more than sufficient for dry-farming. The Indians
supplemented their diet with wild roots, nuts and berries as
well as with meat from large and small game animals.</p>
<p>The period of the cliff dwellings is known as the Classic
Period and marks the climax of Pueblo culture in this region.
The Mesa Verde people made beautiful pottery and decorated
it elaborately with geometric and animal figures in
black on a white or light-gray background. They also made
cotton cloth which they often decorated with colored designs.
Their masonry was of exceptional quality with the building
blocks beautifully shaped and carefully laid in clay mortar.</p>
<p>The Classic Period came to an end shortly before <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300
when the Indians abandoned their homes in the Mesa Verde
and moved away. We can only guess the reasons for such a
move. One suggestion is that the great drouth, which lasted
from <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1276 to <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1299, caused them to leave. Another
suggestion is that this was a period of strife either between
the villages themselves or between these village people and
nomadic groups moving into the area. Whatever the reasons,
the cliff dwellings of the Mesa Verde were empty by <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300.</p>
<p>It was a rancher from Mancos, named Richard Wetherill,
who first discovered Spruce Tree House&mdash;on December 18,
1888. He and his brother-in-law, Charley Mason, also discovered
Cliff Palace that same day. The men had been looking
for lost cattle when they first saw the cliff ruins.</p>

<p>In 1906 Mesa Verde was set aside as a National Park by
Act of Congress to protect and preserve these dwellings of
the prehistoric Indians. In 1908 Dr. Jesse Walter Fewkes
of the Smithsonian Institution excavated Spruce Tree House.
He removed the debris of fallen walls and collapsed roofs
and stabilized the dwellings more or less as you see them now.
It has been necessary, of course, to further stabilize the walls
from time to time, but aside from minor repairs and the
roofing of the three kivas, the dwelling is original work done
by the Indians some 700 to 800 years ago.</p>
<p>The dating of Spruce Tree House and other ruins in the
Mesa Verde has been done by the study of tree-rings from
original roofing timbers. If you are interested in how arch&aelig;ologists
determine the dates, see the exhibit on tree-ring dating
in the museum.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
